You can install ndtilecache on a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 node using the install script in the setup folder.

.. code-block:: console
   
   sudo ./ndtilecache_install.sh

If you want to connect the ndtilecache to the S3-backend, then add your AWS credentials to the settings_secret.py file in the ndtilecache folder. You will need the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY for this which is available in the AWS Management Console->Security Credentials.
